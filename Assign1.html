                    The revolutionary leader of Vedanta philosophy, 
                    the devoted disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, the founder of Ramakrishna Mission – Swami Vivekananda was a regal, majestic figure of commanding presence, vast learning symbol, and deep insight. Only at the age of 30, he created a stir at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893.
                    His vast knowledge of Eastern and Western culture as well as his deep spiritual insight, fervid eloquence, brilliant conversation, broad human sympathy, colourful personality, and handsome figure made an irresistible appeal to the many types of Americans who came in contact with him. People who saw or heard Vivekananda even once still cherish his memory after a lapse of more than half a century.
